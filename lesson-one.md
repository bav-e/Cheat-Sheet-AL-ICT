# **Lesson 1: Core ICT Concepts**

### **1.1: Data, Information & Knowledge**

* **Data** ➔ Raw facts. Uncooked ingredients.  
* **Information** ➔ Data with meaning. The finished cake.  
  * *One system's Information can be another's Data.*  
* **Valuable Info is:**  
  * **Timely:** Fresh.  
  * **Accurate:** Correct.  
  * **Complete:** Full story.  
  * **Relevant:** On-topic.  
* **Big Data:** Google-scale data analysis.

### **1.2: The Need for Technology**

* **Internet:** The global "network of networks".  
  * **TCP/IP (Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol):** Internet's Rulebook / Postal Service.  
  * **Services:** WWW, FTP, Email, Telnet, IRC, Video Conferencing.  
* **WWW:** The collection of websites.  
  * **HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol):** Language for web browsers.  
* **Cloud Computing:** Using someone else's computer online.  
  * **SaaS (Software as a Service):** Rent their finished software.  
  * **PaaS (Platform as a Service):** Rent their workshop.  
  * **IaaS (Infrastructure as a Service):** Rent their land & raw materials.

### **1.3 & 1.4: The Computer System**

**➡️ Abstract Model:** Input ➔ Process ➔ Output

* **Hardware:** The physical parts.  
  * **Input:** Keyboard, Mouse, Scanner, Joystick, Trackball.  
  * **Output:** Monitor, Projector, Printer (Impact: Dot Matrix | Non-Impact: Laser, Inkjet).  
  * **Processing:** CPU (The main **Brain**), GPU (The **Graphics/Artist Brain**).  
  * **Memory:**  
    * **Cache:** CPU's ultra-fast **Notepad**.  
    * **RAM (Primary):** Temporary Workspace. **Volatile** (forgets when power is off).  
    * **Secondary:** Filing Cabinet. **Non-volatile** (remembers always).  
  * **Networking:** NIC, Hub, Switch, Router, Gateway, Bridge.  
* **Software:** The instructions.  
  * **System:** Manages the computer (OS, Utilities, Translators).  
  * **Application:** The "Apps" for tasks (Word, Chrome).  
* **Firmware:** Software built into hardware. The TV remote's brain.  
* **Liveware:** You, the user.  
* **Software Licensing:**  
  * **Proprietary:** A "Secret Recipe".  
  * **FOSS (Open Source):** A "Public Recipe".

### **1.5: Data Processing In Action**

**➡️ The Cycle:** Gathering ➔ Validation ➔ Processing ➔ Output ➔ Storage

* **Gathering Methods:**  
  * **Manual:** Interviews, Questionnaires, Observation.  
  * **Automated:**  
    * **OMR (Optical Mark Reader):** The "MCQ Answer Sheet Reader".  
    * **OCR (Optical Character Reader):** The "Image-to-Text Converter".  
    * **MICR (Magnetic Ink Character Reader):** The "Bank Cheque Reader".  
* **Validation:** The "Data Quality Checkpoint".  
  * **Range Check:** Within limits? (e.g., 0-100).  
  * **Presence Check:** Is it empty?  
  * **Type Check:** Number or text?  
* **Processing Modes:**  
  * **Batch:** "End-of-day" processing. Collect & process in one go.  
  * **Real-time:** "Instant" processing. Immediate response.

### **1.6 & 1.7: ICT's Role & Impact on Society**

* **Key Applications:**  
  * **CAD (Computer-Aided Design):** The "Engineer's Digital Drawing Board".  
  * **RFID (Radio-Frequency Identification):** A "Wireless Barcode".  
* **Key Societal Issues:**  
  * **Digital Divide:** The "Tech Haves vs. Tech Have-Nots".  
  * **E-waste:** Discarded electronics.  
    * **Green Computing:** "Eco-Friendly Tech".  
* **Ethical & Legal Issues (The "Don'ts"):**  
  * **Piracy:** Stealing software/media.  
  * **Plagiarism:** Copying someone's work.  
  * **Phishing:** A "Fake Login" trap.  
  * **Copyright / Intellectual Property:** Creator's legal ownership.  
  * **Confidentiality:** Keeping data "Secret".  
  * **Netiquette:** Internet Ethics / Good Manners.
