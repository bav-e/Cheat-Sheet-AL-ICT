# **Lesson 5 Cheat Sheet: Operating Systems**

### **The Goal**

To create a comprehensive, single-page reference sheet that covers the core functions and concepts of an Operating System. The structure will be designed to make it easy to recall definitions, compare different methods, and understand the relationships between various components, which is ideal for answering MCQ questions.

### **The Structure: "The Four Pillars of an OS"**

This lesson can be logically divided into the four main responsibilities of an OS. We will structure the cheat sheet around these four pillars, creating four distinct sections. This makes it easy to find information and understand the context of each concept.

1. **Pillar 1: Introduction to the OS**  
   * This section will cover the fundamental "what" and "why" of an OS. It will include the definition, its main goals, a brief history of its evolution, and the different ways operating systems are classified.  
2. **Pillar 2: Process & Scheduling Management**  
   * This section focuses on how the OS handles running programs. It will cover the lifecycle of a process, the data structure used to manage it (PCB), and the different schedulers that decide which process runs when.  
3. **Pillar 3: File & Storage Management**  
   * This section will explain how the OS organizes data on storage devices. It will cover file systems, the different methods for allocating space to files (Contiguous, Linked, Indexed), and the concepts of fragmentation and security.  
4. **Pillar 4: Memory & Device Management**  
   * This final section will cover advanced resource management. It will explain key technologies like Virtual Memory and Paging, and how the OS communicates with hardware using Device Drivers and manages slow devices with Spooling.

## **Content List for the Cheat Sheet**

Here is the detailed list of points, organized according to the four-pillar structure, that should be included.

### **Part 1: Introduction to the OS**

* **Definition:** System software acting as an intermediary between user/apps and hardware.  
* **Main Goals:**  
  * Provide a Virtual Machine (hides complexity).  
  * Manage resources.  
  * Execute applications.  
* **Evolution Timeline:**  
  * No OS (Serial Processing).  
  * Simple Batch Systems (used tapes, improved CPU use).  
  * Multi-programmed Systems (multiple programs in memory).  
  * Time-Sharing Systems (interactive, uses context switching).  
* **OS Classification:**  
  * Single-user / Single-task  
  * Single-user / Multi-task  
  * Multi-user / Multi-task  
  * Real-Time OS (RTOS): For systems needing precise timing (e.g., industrial control).

### **Part 2: Process & Scheduling Management**

* **Process vs. Program:** Program is passive code on disk; Process is a "program in execution".  
* **Process State Diagram (5-State Model):**  
  * A visual diagram showing New → Ready → Running → Terminated, and the Blocked/Waiting state.  
* **Process Control Block (PCB):** The "ID Card" for a process, containing its State, ID, Program Counter, CPU Registers, etc.  
* **Context Switching:** The mechanism of saving one process's state (to its PCB) and loading another's to share the CPU.  
* **Interrupt:** A signal that causes the CPU to pause its current task to handle an event.  
* **Schedulers:**  
  * **Long-term (Job Scheduler):** Decides which jobs enter the system. Controls the degree of multiprogramming.  
  * **Short-term (CPU Scheduler):** Picks the next process to run. Very fast.  
  * **Medium-term:** Swaps processes out of memory.  
* **Scheduling Policies:**  
  * **Non-preemptive:** A process runs until it finishes or self-blocks.  
  * **Preemptive:** The OS can force a process to give up the CPU.  
* **Performance Metrics:** Definitions for Turnaround Time, Response Time, Throughput, Waiting Time.

### **Part 3: File & Storage Management**

* **File Systems:** FAT (older, simple) vs. NTFS (modern, with security, error recovery).  
* **Storage Allocation Methods:**  
  * **Contiguous:** One single block of space. *Pro: Fast. Con: External Fragmentation.*  
  * **Linked:** Blocks are scattered, linked by pointers. *Pro: No external fragmentation. Con: Slow random access.*  
  * **Indexed:** An "index block" points to all data blocks.  
* **Fragmentation:** When a single file is broken into many scattered pieces.  
* **Defragmentation:** The process of rearranging fragmented files back into a continuous block.  
* **File Security:** Passwords and Access Privileges.

### **Part 4: Memory & Device Management**

* **Virtual Memory:** Using the disk as an extension of RAM, allowing programs to be larger than physical memory.  
* **Paging:** Dividing logical memory into pages and physical memory into frames.  
* **MMU (Memory Management Unit):** The hardware that translates virtual addresses to physical addresses.  
* **Device Driver:** A specific software that acts as a translator between the OS and a hardware device.  
* **Spooling (Simultaneous Peripheral Operations On-Line):** Using a buffer (on disk) to hold jobs for a slow device like a printer, freeing up the CPU.
