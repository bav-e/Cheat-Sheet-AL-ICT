# **Plan for Lesson 13: New Trends and Future Directions of ICT**

### **The Goal**

To create a single-page A4 cheat sheet covering new trends in computer science, artificial intelligence, agent technology, and future computing models, as per Competency 13 of the A/L ICT syllabus. This plan is now updated with key concepts from the official resource book.

### **The Structure: "From Artificial Intelligence to Future Computing"**

This cheat sheet is logically divided into three parts, starting from intelligent concepts and progressing to autonomous software and future computing models.

## **Cheat Sheet Content**

### **Part 1: "The Thinking Machine" \- Artificial Intelligence & Coexistence (Competency Level 13.1)**

*This section focuses on the fundamental concepts of artificial intelligence and the interaction between humans and machines.*

* **Intelligent and Emotional Computing:**  
  * The concept of machines that can think and perceive emotions.  
* **Artificial Intelligence (AI):**  
  * **Definition:** The simulation of human intelligence processes by machines.  
  * **Strong AI (Artificial General Intelligence \- AGI):** An AI system that can think and have a mind, capable of working in multiple fields. (Still theoretical).  
  * **Weak AI (Artificial Narrow Intelligence):** An AI system that can only pretend to think. It demonstrates intelligence in a single, narrow task.  
    * *Examples:* IBM Deep Blue (Chess), AlphaGo (Go).  
* **Key AI Techniques (from Resource Book):**  
  * **Search Techniques:** Finding a goal state in a state space (e.g., in a board game).  
  * **Expert Systems:** Rule-based systems (If-Then) that store knowledge to advise humans.  
  * **Natural Language Processing (NLP):** Algorithms to recognize and understand human languages.  
  * **Machine Learning:** Techniques that allow systems to learn hidden patterns from data.  
  * **Neural Networks:** A key Machine Learning technique based on a network of artificial neurons.  
  * **Genetic Algorithms:** Optimization algorithms based on the biological process of evolution.  
  * **Fuzzy Logic Systems:** A technique for control systems based on "fuzzy" linguistic statements (e.g., 'hot', 'fast') rather than binary true/false.  
* **Coexistence:**  
  * **Man-Machine Coexistence:** Humans and intelligent machines working together.  
  * **Machine-to-Machine Coexistence:** Intelligent machines communicating and acting with each other without human intervention.

### **Part 2: "The Autonomous Agent" \- Agent Technology (Competency Level 13.2)**

*This section focuses on autonomously operating software and their systems.*

* **Software Agents:**  
  * **Definition:** A piece of software that acts on behalf of a user or program, working autonomously and continuously.  
  * **Characteristics:** Autonomous, Proactive, Reactive, Cooperative, Able to learn, Social ability.  
* **Multi-Agent Systems (MAS):**  
  * **Definition:** A system composed of multiple interacting software agents to solve a complex problem.  
  * **Characteristics:** Agents are autonomous, have a **local view** (only know their part), and act in a **decentralized** manner.  
  * **Common Architecture:** An **Interface Agent** connects the user to a **Broker Agent**, which filters information from multiple **Information Agents**.  
* **Applications of Agent Systems:**  
  * Virtual assistants (Siri, Cortana), e-commerce search, online booking systems.

### **Part 3: "Future Computing" \- Beyond the von Neumann Limit (Competency Level 13.3)**

*This section explores advanced and future computing models that go beyond the limitations of current computer architectures.*

* **Beyond von-Neumann Computer:**  
  * **Reason:** Traditional architecture is reaching physical limits (e.g., heat generated by increasing transistors, as described by Moore's Law).  
* **Nature-Inspired Computing:**  
  * Algorithms modeled on natural phenomena.  
  * *Examples:* Genetic Algorithms, Neural Networks, **Swarm Intelligence** (based on ant colonies, bee hives), **Membrane Computing** (based on living cells).  
* **Bio-Inspired Computing:**  
  * Computing models based on biological systems (e.g., DNA, the brain). Closely related to Nature-Inspired Computing.  
* **Quantum Computing:**  
  * **Fundamentals:** Computing based on quantum mechanics (using Qubits which can be in a state of **Superposition**).  
  * **Applications:** Solving complex problems, drug discovery, materials science.
